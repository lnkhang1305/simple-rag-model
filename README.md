# simple-rag-model
This repository contains a simple implementation of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, a method for enhancing the capabilities of language models by integrating document retrieval. The RAG model combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches, enabling the generation of more accurate and contextually relevant responses by referencing external documents.
# Installation
